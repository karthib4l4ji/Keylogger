# Keylogger(Keyxtract)
Python 3x based keylogger
This is a simple Python 3x based keylogger. In order to use this keylogger first you need to turn of the two factor authentication for your mail
id and turn on the less secure apps to make python to interact with your mail server.
Whenever you'd like to get any kind of information from the victim side, you are suppose to drop some payload into their system 
to communicate with yours right?. That must be done via social engineering attacks like binding this payload with game with the assistance of PyInstaller etc.
you get the idea!
You don't need to do anything with the Keyxtract.py file. Just mention your email, password and time interval in trigger.py file then, you are pretty much good to go!
## Disclaimer
It's always a good practice to set the time interval more than 240 sec in trigger.py file or else this will spam your mailbox.
Do not use this for the illegal purposes this is for research and educational purpose only.
